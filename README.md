# Tonight
![Tonight Logo](./src/Assets/tonight-logo.png)

What's is there to do in my city? This is the question that this app tries to help answer. Tonight provides information about events going on in your city now and also in the future, should you wish to book ahead of time.

## About the application

This is a React application which utilises a backend proxy Express.js API (deployed on AWS) which in turn queries the Ticketmaster API to return events for city (UK city) passed in to the search bar. This is likely to be expanded and refined in the future, should we decide to take this beyond our course.

## Stack Employed

- ReactJS
- AWS deployed using serverless
- Express.js

## Project Status

This project is still in development and MVP is not yet complete.
